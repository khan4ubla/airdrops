              TERMS, FEES, AND TAXES. 2.1. UPFRONT FEES. This Agreement and the
              provision of Services agreed to herein are subject to the
              Customer’s satisfaction of an upfront payment of a fixed amount,
              set in US Dollars for the given hash rate (“Upfront Fees”). The
              company ECOS-M doesn't accept payments in cryptocurrencies and
              doesn't conduct exchange operations. These operations are
              fulfilled with the help of partners: • CoinPayments Inc. and
              Hodltech OÜ (“Hodltech”) • Zaka Capital, The Netherlands 2.2.
              CLOUD MINING SERVICE FEES. The Customer shall pay and owe ECOS-M
              certain data center operations service fees (“Service Fees”) for
              use of the Services as described in this Agreement. ECOS-M shall
              calculate and automatically deduct the Service Fees from
              Customer’s Hash Rate Output on a daily basis. Service Fees are
              indicated in contracts per 1 unit of computational power for one
              day of contract operation. So the Service Fees of a particular
              contract is calculated by multiplying the amount of computational
              power unit by service fee rate, defined in the contract. In the
              event that the Hash Rate Output for one or more days does not
              satisfy the Service Fees, ECOS-M may deduct the Service Fees from
              any subsequent Hash Rate Output during the Term of the Agreement.
              Service fee is a subject to unilateral change by ECOS-M. 2.3.
              BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION FEES. The delivery and receipt of any of
              the Customer’s digital assets is subject to network or transaction
              fees charged by the blockchain associated with the
              Customer-selected algorithm (“Blockchain Transaction Fees”).
              Blockchain Transaction Fees are paid to emit, record, verify, and
              process a transaction on the blockchain and not retained by
              ECOS-M. 2.4. THIRD-PARTY FEES. Certain digital wallets, wallet
              addresses, tools, and third-party software and devices
              (“Third-Party Wallets”) used by the Customer may also charge
              Customer a fee, including a per transaction or transfer fee.
              Customer is responsible for being aware of and satisfying any such
              fee. Customer should note that any such fees may significantly
              reduce Customer’s Hash Rate Output and therefore Customer is
              responsible for managing the selection, use, and rate and
              frequency of their delivery of Hash Rate Output to any such
              Third-Party Wallets. 2.5. TAXES. The Customer is responsible for
              any taxes, and the Customer will pay ECOS-M for Services without
              any reduction for taxes. If ECOS-M is obligated to collect or pay
              Taxes, Taxes will be invoiced to the Customer and/or deduced from
              the Customer’s Hash Rate Output, unless the Customer provides
              ECOS-M with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate
              authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some countries,
              states, and provinces, the sales tax is due on the total purchase
              price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at
              the time of the sale. If the Customer is required by law to
              withhold any taxes from its payments to ECOS-M, the Customer must
              provide ECOS-M with an official tax receipt or other appropriate
              documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable
              tax legislation, the Services are subject to local value added tax
              (“VAT”) and the Customer is required to make a withholding of
              local VAT from amounts payable to ECOS-M, the value of the
              Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be
              increased (grossed up) by the Customer for the respective amount
              of local VAT and the grossed-up amount will be regarded as a VAT
              inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive
              price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the
              Customer and the Customer will ensure that ECOS-M will receives
              payment for its services for the net amount as would otherwise be
              due (the VAT-inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and
              remitted to applicable tax authority). If required under
              applicable law, the Customer will provide ECOS-M with applicable
              tax identification information that ECOS-M may require to ensure
              its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in
              applicable jurisdictions. The Customer will be liable to pay (or
              reimburse ECOS-M for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines
              arising out of any mis-declaration by the Customer. 3. CUSTOMER
              OBLIGATIONS. 3.1. ALGORITHM SELECTION. The Customer is responsible
              for the selection of the algorithm and understands and accepts the
              risks associated with blockchain technologies, cryptographic
              currencies, and digital asset extraction. 3.2. HASH RATE
              ALLOCATION. The Customer is responsible for the allocation of the
              Customer’s hash rate purchased under this Agreement. The Customer
              acknowledges that ECOS-M is not responsible for the selection or
              timing of Hash Rate Output to be mined under this Agreement and
              protocols selected for use in connection with the Services. The
              Customer shall monitor and allocate hash rate through the
              Dashboard. The Customer acknowledges that the difficulty of
              digital assets extraction may vary and will likely increase during
              the Term of this Agreement and Customer shall monitor, supervise,
              and determine which digital assets to mine under this Agreement.
              3.3. DIGITAL WALLET AND PRIVATE KEYS. The Customer represents and
              warrants that the Customer is familiar with and accepts the risks
              associated with digital wallets and private keys, including the
              risks described in this Section 3.3. The Customer’s digital wallet
              or vault may require a private key, or a combination of private
              keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s)
              associated with the Customer’s digital wallet or vault storing
              Hash Rate Output will result in loss of such Hash Rate Output,
              access to the Customer’s Hash Rate Output balance and/or any
              initial balances in blockchains. Moreover, any third-party that
              gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access
              to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service the
              Customer uses, may be able to misappropriate the Customer’s
              digital assets. ECOS-M is not responsible for any such losses.
              3.4. LOG-IN CREDENTIALS. The Customer represents and warrants that
              the Customer is responsible for the preservation of
              confidentiality of the Customer’s login credentials. ECOS-M log-in
              credentials and generated by the Services are for the Customer’s
              internal use only and the Customer is strictly prohibited from
              selling, transferring, or sublicensing them to any other entity or
              person. 3.5. BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK RISK. The Customer represents and
              warrants that the Customer accepts the risks of blockchain
              protocol and network, including instability, congestion, high
              transaction costs, network latency, information security,
              regulatory risk, and technological and operational error. The
              Customer understand that these risks may result in delay or
              failure to process transactions, failure to delivery Hash Rate
              Output, and high Blockchain Transaction Fees. The Customer
              represents that Customer understands and agrees that the Company
              is not responsible for any diminished Services, related features,
              or capabilities resulting from blockchain network risk. As
              provided in Section 1.4 (Hash Rate Output), in the event of a
              material increase or decrease to Blockchain Transaction Fees or
              operational degradation, congestion, failure or disruption
              otherwise of the blockchain network used by Customer, the Company
              may, at its sole discretion and upon notice to the Customer,
              increase or decrease the threshold to deliver the Customer’s Hash
              Rate Output. 3.6. BLOCKCHAIN MODIFICATION RISK. The Customer
              represents and warrants that the Customer is familiar with and
              accepts the risks associated with blockchain development and code
              changes, including the risks described in this Section 3.6.
              Blockchain technologies are still under development and may
              undergo significant changes over time. Blockchain developers may
              make changes to features and specifications of the algorithm
              selected by the Customer. Such changes may include or result in
              the elimination for support for and/or the efficient use of chips
              used by ECOS-M. In addition, blockchain developers may also
              determiner to modify the cryptographic verification process such
              that the blockchains can no longer be verified through
              proof-of-work and instead adopt proof-of-stake methodologies. 3.7.
              PROOF-OF-WORK REPLACEMENT RISK. In addition to blockchain
              modification risk, blockchain developers may also determine to
              modify the cryptographic verification process such that the
              blockchains can no longer be verified through proof-of-work and
              instead adopt proof-of-stake methodologies. Customer accepts and
              acknowledges that in circumstances where the protocol of a given
              blockchain used by the Customer has been modified to only use
              proof-of-stake methodologies, the Customer accepts such risk and
              shall allocate Customer’s hash rate to other available blockchains
              and output processes that use proof-of-work methodologies using
              the given algorithm for this Agreement. Certain blockchain
              algorithms at this time have no alternative blockchain
              applications that support proof-of-work output and any such switch
              from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake would result in no applicable
              use of Customer’s hash rate for the residual Term of the Agreement
              should such a protocol switch occur. 3.8. TRADE COMPLIANCE. In
              connection with this Agreement, the Customer agrees that the
              Customer will comply with all applicable import, re-import,
              sanctions, anti-boycott, export, and re-export control laws and
              regulations, including all such laws and regulations that apply to
              European Union and U.S. companies, such as the Export
              Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
              Regulations, and economic sanctions programs implemented by the
              Office of Foreign Assets Control and the European Union’s Common
              Foreign and Security Policy (“CFSP”) (collectively, “Trade
              Sanctions Laws”). The Customer represents and warrants that the
              Customer and Customer’s financial institutions, or any party that
              owns or controls the Customer or the Customer’s financial
              institutions, are not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated
              on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not
              limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security
              Council, the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated
              Nationals List and Foreign as Evaders List of the U.S. Department
              of Treasury, and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of
              Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other
              applicable government authority. 3.9. RESIDENCE. The Customer is

              suspend personal account of part or all functionality without
              prior notification of the Customer in case of suspicion of

              of creditors or similar disposition assets, or become the subject
              of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
              similar proceeding. 4.2. EFFECT OF SUSPENSION. If ECOS-M suspends
              the Customer’s right to access or use any portion or all of the
              Services, the Customer may remain responsible for all fees and
              charges the Customer incurs during the period of suspension; and
              the Customer will not be entitled to any digital asset extraction

              any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing ECOS-M
              and the Customer agree that ECOS-M may bring suit in court to
              enjoin infringement or other misuse of ECOS-M’s intellectual
              property rights. The law of this arbitration clause shall be
              Republic of Armenia law. 13.4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement
              sets out all terms agreed between the parties and supersedes all
              other agreements between the parties relating to its subject
              matter. In entering into this Agreement, neither party has relied
              on, and neither party will have any right or remedy based on, any
              statement, representation or warranty (whether made negligently or
              innocently), except those expressly set out in this Agreement. The
              terms located at a URL referenced in this Agreement and the
              Documentation are incorporated by reference into the Agreement.
              After the Effective Date, ECOS-M may provide an updated URL in
              place of any URL in this Agreement. 13.5. FORCE MAJEURE. ECOS-M
              and its affiliates will not be liable for any failure or delay in
              performance of obligation under this Agreement where the failures
              or delay results from any cause beyond our reasonable control,
              including, but not limited to, acts of God, labor disputes or
              other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages,
              utilities or other telecommunications failures, earthquake, storms
              or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or
              orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war. Force Majeure
              events include, but are not limited to, upgrades to the validation
              rules of a given blockchain (e.g., a “hard fork” or “soft fork”).
              ECOS-M protects safety of the Customer by reserving a right to
              buy-back digital assets in case of the situation, when authorities
              of the Customer’s State of residence prohibit using of
              cryptocurrencies, mining or blockchain technology. ECOS-M creates
              extra guarantees for the Customer by reserving a right to buy-back
              digital assets in case of any situation, including even force
              majeure situations defined above. 13.6. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.
              All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
              Services will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Armenia,
              excluding the Country’s conflicts of laws rules, and will be
              litigated exclusively in the courts of the Republic of Armenia.
              The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
              International Sale of Goods does not govern this Agreement. 13.7.
              LANGUAGE. All communications and notices made or given pursuant to
              this Agreement must be in the English language. If we provide a
              translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the
              English language version of the Agreement will control if there is
              any conflict. 13.8. NO AGENCY. This Agreement does not create any
              agency, partnership or joint venture between ECOS-M and the
              Customer. 13.9. NOTICES TO CUSTOMER. ECOS-M may provide any notice
              to the Customer under this Agreement by: (i) posting a notice on
              the ECOS-M website; or (ii) sending a message to the email address
              then associated with the Customer’s personal account. Notices we
              provide by posting on the ECOS-M website will be effective upon
              posting and notices we provide by email will be effective when we
              send the email. It is the Customer’s responsibility to keep the
              Customer’s email address current. The Customer will be deemed to
              have received any email sent to the email address then associated
              with the Customer’s personal account when ECOS-M sends the email,
              whether or not the Customer actually receive the email. 13.10.
              NOTICES TO ECOS-M. To give us notice under this Agreement, the
              Customer must contact ECOS-M by facsimile transmission or personal
              delivery, overnight courier or registered or certified mail to the
              mailing address listed for the applicable ECOS-M entity on the
              ECOS-M website. We may update the address for notices to us by
              posting a notice on the Platform. Notices provided by personal
              delivery will be effective immediately. Notices provided by
              overnight courier will be effective one business day after they
              are sent. Notices provided registered or certified mail will be
              effective five business days after they are sent. 13.11. LEGAL
              PROVISIONS. Buying a mining contract or other purchases performed
              on the Platform should not be contrary to the laws of the country
              in which the Customer is a resident. The Customer pays
              independently all tax payments stipulated by the legislation of
              the country of the Customer. The Customer is responsible for all
              tax deductions. The Customer is informed that he (she) is not
              allowed to perform purchases on the Platform using debit/credit
              cards that do not belong to the Customer without notarized
              permission of the legit cardholder that might be requested at any
              time by ECOS-M. Pricing explanation The cost of mining contracts
              is adjusted depending on various factors, such as the exchange
              rate of cryptocurrency, the complexity of the network and the
              price for electricity (for the last 3 months). The contract price
              is fixed at the time of purchase and remains unchanged with
              subsequent price changes on the site. ECOS-M does not compensate
              the Customer for the difference in the price of the contract after
              adjusting the value of the contracts. Explanation of computational
              power fluctuations Variations in computing power may be
              unavoidable due to network instability, mining equipment
              performance, and mining pool luck. ECOS-M cannot guarantee 100%
              stability of mining. Uncontrolled Risk Explanation ECOS-M is not
              responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under the
              mining contract in the event of force majeure circumstances (the
              list is not limited to the following paragraphs): natural
              disasters such as floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
              landslides, fires, storms and weather conditions, government
              actions and government directives; power outages; wars, strikes,
              riots, etc. 13.12. SEVERABILITY. If any portion of this Agreement
              is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of
              this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any invalid
              or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to effect and intent
              of the original portion. If such construction is not possible, the
              invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this
              Agreement but the rest of the Agreement will remain in full force
              and effect. ECOS-M CLOUD SERVICES TERMS OF SERVICE SPECIFICATIONS
