              Executive summary The cryptocurrency industry is based on a simple
              premise: people should be fully in control of their finances.
              While it seems like a simple and obvious statement, the current
              systems are far from providing financial services that are truly
              under the control of the people who use them. The mission of
              DeFiChain is to give people (and in the future, machines, and
              devices) seamless access to decentralized financial services. For
              that purpose, we are introducing DeFiChain, a dedicated blockchain
              specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi)
              https://defichain.com. By dedicating the functionality of a
              blockchain specifically to decentralized finance, DeFiChain
              provides high transaction throughput, reduced risk of errors, and
              intelligent feature development specifically for the fulfillment
              of Satoshi’s original intent: To create a reliable alternative
              form of financial services built on top of Bitcoin. Bitcoin, as
              described in the original Satoshi whitepaper, is designed as a
              form of digital cash, as a store and exchange of value. The
              evolution to Ethereum and smart contracts has allowed for
              tremendous new functionalities to be built on top of a blockchain,
              yet this development has come at a cost. The concept of one global
              operating system for everything has created a system that requires
              a complex codebase for smart contracts, slow throughput, and
              difficulty around the governance of the system. DeFiChain
              approaches decentralized finance as a specific and critical
              segment of the blockchain community. DeFi is a dedicated
              blockchain that is optimized specifically for DeFi applications.
              DeFiChain is intentionally non-Turing-Complete and does not
              support any function, other than those needed for Decentralized
              Finance, resulting in a blockchain that provides higher throughput
              and better functionality specifically for dApps related to
              finance. The advantage of a non-Turing complete command set is
              that there is a much lower potential for coding errors of the type
              that have plagued Ethereum smart contracts such as with the DAO
              hack or the locked funds with Parity. While it is important that
              we have some smart contract languages that are Turing complete, in
              the area of finance, it is appropriate to restrict the
              capabilities of the language in favor of a more secure system with
              greatly-reduced attack vectors. The Problem Today, almost all
              financial services are run by banks. Investments, for example, by
              definition, is the use of capital to earn more capital. Investors
              use a bank to put their money into interest or dividend-making
              instruments in order to grow their wealth. The problems with
              financial services are increasingly becoming obvious to everyone:
              compounded costs due to middle(wo)men, slow transactions, delays
              for cross-border transactions, and inaccessibility to many sectors
              of the population. A myriad of fintech solutions have been brought
              in to improve the system, but fundamentally the underlying banking
              system is still in control, so fintech has brought only limited
              improvements. Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
              offer a way to start with a new system, circumventing the
              difficulties faced in changing the finance industry. While crypto
              has attracted billions in investments, decentralized financial
              services are lagging. When it comes to investment in
              cryptocurrency, crypto investors can buy and sell, but that’s it.
              The cryptocurrency itself cannot be invested in the same way fiat
              currency can be. Initial attempts to create peer-to-peer lending
              and asset tokenization so far have proven partial and unreliable,
              so investors have extremely limited options when it comes to an
              investment of their cryptoassets. The potential is enormous to
              provide financial services in crypto, the same way they are
              offered in fiat currency. The Solution DeFiChain is designed for
              investors in the cryptocurrency market who are looking to make
              their cryptocurrency work just like any other form of capital,
              such that they can ensure a return on investment in any market.
              DeFiChain is a dedicated non-Turing-complete blockchain, designed
              specifically for the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. DeFi
              provides full functionality for this specific segment of the DLT
              community, sacrificing other types of functionality for
              simplicity, rapid throughput, and security. The function set
              includes among others: Decentralized lending Decentralized
              wrapping of tokens Decentralized Pricing oracles Decentralized
              exchanges Transferable debts and receivables Decentralized
              Non-collateralized debt Asset tokenization Distribution of
              Dividends

              Background/Industry DeFi’s promises and challenges Decentralized
              Finance promises to provide a variety of financial instruments
              without the need for middle(wo)men to ensure that the services are
              trusted. According to the OECD, financial services typically make
              up 20–30% of total service market revenue and about 20% of the
              total gross domestic product in developed economies1. This is an
              enormous industry dedicated to one thing: making sure that
              financial transactions are trusted. With the advent of blockchain,
              trustless systems and smart contracts can be used to replace much
              of the functionality of this industry, dramatically increasing the
              return on investment for the individual investor. Financial
              services today are providing an important service, but at a very
              high cost, and despite many fintech developments, the following
              underlying issues persist: High transaction costs. Due to
              regulatory requirements, legacy systems with complex
              interoperability issues, and control by large institutions,
              transaction fees are high for the average user of banking and
              financial services. Services that require a broker are even more
              expensive, as agents and other types of middlemen are involved.
              Slow transactions, particularly for international transactions.
              Although theoretically, it should only take minutes for computers
              to transact, moving money from one institution to another can take
              hours within a country, and it can take days between countries.
              Lack of transparency and unfair advantages to large players.
              Financial instruments are complex and most people do not have
              access to the information that would allow them to make optimal
              decisions. Lack of transparency is one of the major factors that
              led to the 2008 financial crisis and in the short term, it always
              leaves smaller investors (the average person) at a disadvantage
              compared to institutional investors. Inaccessibility and/or higher
              cost to lower-income people. Financial services are simply not
              available in many geographies, and when they are, lower-income
              people are hit with even higher fees (percentage-wise) than
              average. Despite legislation to reduce money laundering and
              related crimes, there is almost no evidence to suggest the current
              system or AML is, in fact, reducing money laundering. Fintech has
              been attempting to address these problems, with some success.
              Fintech solutions such as online international transfer services,
              savings, and investment apps, and mobile money for underserved
              markets have begun to improve the situation. However, the change
              is incremental, and is still built on top of a system that
              fundamentally requires the overhead of agents to provide trust.
              While some of the costs can be reduced, fundamentally, fintech
              can’t address the underlying issues of lack of transparency
              because it is dealing in the same financial instruments and going
              through the same major institutions as traditional finance.

              The state of DeFi The current state of Decentralized Finance
              (DeFi) is populated by general purpose blockchains, most of which
              provide Turing-complete command sets for the development of smart
              contracts on the chain. While appropriate for many programming
              languages, this dogmatic pursuit of Turing-complete smart
              contracts languages has resulted in a variety of problems when it
              comes to scalability, security and robustness of the blockchains.
              The sheer mass of dApps on networks such as Ethereum, EOS and TRON
              have potential (or proven) impact on other dApps on the network.
              The most obvious example was when CryptoKitties ground the
              Ethereum network practically to a halt. While some of the
              faster-throughput networks say this can’t happen, it will be some
              time before any other network reaches the critical mass of apps on
              Ethereum so that we can prove whether this is or isn’t the case.
              For serious financial type dApps, it’s important to know that the
              network is being maintained and managed in a responsible and
              secure manner. Having a blockchain that is swamped with games,
              gambling and other types of less “mission critical” apps will
              ultimately influence the development and direction of the
              blockchains. With governance models that allocate power to
              masternodes, dev groups, and token-holders, the core development
              team will ultimately be influenced by the biggest players.
              Decentralized Finance apps can’t afford the potential consequences
              of sharing a blockchain with anyone who chooses to use that
              operating system. Using Turing-complete command sets requires
              programmers to create complex programs to develop any kind of app.
              For example, to create a peer-to-peer lending contract on top of
              MakerDAO, a programmer requires approximately 2000 lines of code.
              Any bug in that code can cause loss of the funds, or some other
              consequence. Maintaining such a large code base intrinsically
              means larger chances for mistakes and a large attack surface for
              even simple apps. The limitations of general-purpose blockchains
              for DeFi apps has opened up a market opportunity to serve this
              market. While cryptocurrency momentum has continued to rise, most
              of the current applications are still on Ethereum. Concerns about
              the network have already led some of the major projects to
              consider porting or working with alternative or additional
              blockchains. DeFi’s current problems Finance dApps require
              reliability and do not want to be associated with blockchains that
              host apps such as betting, entertainment or other apps that may
              tarnish the reputation of a blockchain at any time. Sudden
              increases in volume of any dApp on a blockchain can potentially
              impact all the other dApps on that blockchain, either in terms of
              throughput, transaction price, or additional impacts, as seen with
              CryptoKitties on Ethereum. General-purpose blockchains require a
              large amount of coding to provide financial services, increasing
              the risk of hackability or bugs in the code. Functionalities that
              are basic requirements for financial services, such as multisig,
              are often difficult to implement or missing on general-purpose
              blockchains. Maintenance of a Turing-complete blockchain means
              that resources are not focusing on the areas valued by DeFi apps.
              Governance models of most of today’s blockchains are immature and
              showing signs of politicization, centralization and uncertainty.
              Without formal governance structures, the future of these
              blockchains is uncertain. Recent discussions of upgrades and forks
              in both Ethereum and Bitcoin have revealed the immaturity of these
              systems, and even the leader in governance, Aragon, showed the
              vulnerability of its on-chain governance system in the summer 2019
              vote, where one large “whale” token-holder changed the outcome of
              several proposal votes at the last minute. Such vulnerabilities
              are unacceptable on blockchains dealing with finance. Regulatory
              standards and regulatory bodies that appropriately address the
              needs of natively cross-border currencies and financial
              instruments. Jurisdiction-based regulation, and regulation based
              on legacy technology is falling short of the needs of the DeFi
              industry. It is clear that a new legal and regulatory framework is
              needed to protect the rights of people using these systems. The
              blockchain industry itself has not shown the maturity to put in
              place its own standards bodies that will provide best practices or
              self-regulation in a way that would demonstrate the industry’s
              reliability for decentralized finance applications. To date,
              attempts at creating interoperability or self-regulation have been
              immature and have not resulted in leadership or standards that
              could be adopted by international bodies or serious regulators.
              The lack of self-regulation leaves the industry even more
              vulnerable to regulation from outside, making the environment
              risky for serious investors. Consequences in the DeFi Market
              Multisig wallets are the best the industry has to provide when it
              comes to joint management of funds, and the solutions for
              multi-sig are, to some degree, kludges. Multisig tends to be
              leger-specific and not flexible for different scenarios. For
              example, in traditional finance, multi-signature accounts can
              assign signatories different levels of authority, or require
              different signatures for different transaction types and levels.
              Different chains take different approaches to adding multisig
              capabilities to their existing blockchains. The BIP 11: M-of-N
              Standard Transactions is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
              (BIP)designed to add multisig support to Bitcoin blockchain.
              Ethereum provides a Turing-complete command set for development of
              multisig on chain, leading to multiple entities providing multisig
              smart contracts. Bugs such as those in the Parity multisig
              (discussed below) have resulted in untold sums in lost funds. As a
              result of the complexity of the code required for multisig, in
              2017, more than 150,000 ETH was lost to a hack in the Parity
              multisig wallet, due to an error in the code2. The referenced
              article notes ways in which this code bug could have been avoided,
              but it emphasizes the point that these complexities in coding
              cause many different attack vectors. An entire industry has
              sprouted up around smart contract auditing, because the situation
              is so vulnerable. In the largest industry hack (or bug?!), The DAO
              was drained of 3.6 million ETH due to a coding error in the smart
              contract holding all of the funds of The DAO. One of the many
              results is that the high risks get priced in to the underlying
              contracts leading to excessive costs for users, as can be seen
              when comparing rates from DeFi and non-DeFi examples. (For example
              8% with decentralized DAI to 1.75% with centralized USDC (dated at
              the beginning of October 2019): https://deficompare.com/) Both
              coins represent 1 USD but the decentralized version ist 6.25% more
              expensive due to a priced in risk from the Ethereum contract. The
              points described above are simply unacceptable for any type of
              financial transaction or investor. For that reason, it’s important
              to build dedicated services that will prevent such breaches, lower
              risks and thus cost. In the Blockchain world, having proper
              programming rules and reducing the attack vectors prevents this
              kind of attack. Comparing existing DeFi alternatives Bitcoin: Why
              Not? Given our optimism on Bitcoin, the first question one might
              ask is why not develop DeFi using the Bitcoin Blockchain. While
              Bitcoin allows only basic smart contracts, some projects have
              begun developing workarounds. However, the transaction costs are
              restrictive on the Bitcoin chain, and we don’t believe it is going
              to be appropriate for the speed required for financial
              transactions. The Bitcoin chain is currently working as designed
              as a store of value. In our opinion, sticking to that single
              purpose is the best use of the chain and it is proven over the
              last decade. Adding financial services into the main chain adds
              unnecessary complexity and may cause side effects both for DeFi
              and for Bitcoin that are undesirable. Furthermore, it is not
              something we think that the Bitcoin governance is prepared to
              handle, and at some point, if DeFiChain requirements differed from
              those of the miners or developers on the Bitcoin chain, we would
              be subject to their decisions. Turing-complete Solutions:
              Ethereum, EOS, Tron… To date, a number of DeFi applications have
              been built on Ethereum, Tron, EOS and many other turing-complete
              chains. Since Ethereum has the biggest adoption it allowed the
              surfacing of issues that come with using a turing-complete
              blockchain for DeFi applications the fastest. The DAO hack was one
              of the first and most dramatic exposures of the vulnerability of
              using such a complex language. Anyone issuing a token on the
              network knows how difficult it is. Just to create and issue an
              ERC20 token can easily cost over 100,000 USD, considering the cost
              of smart contract auditing that is necessary for innovative
              solutions. Simply the fact that there’s an entire industry built
              around “smart contract audits” should be enough to illustrate the
              problem. Despite the fact that ERC20 is the industry standard,
              it’s still so easy to hack that it’s impossible to issue even a
              simple token without getting a high-cost professional auditor as
              well as a programmer. On an even more stark note, it’s now
              possible to scan for exploitable code using automation, and a 2018
              study managed to scan a million smart contracts, finding over
              34,000 hackable smart contracts3. It’s unfathomable that 3.4% of
              financial transactions would be vulnerable. While this at the
              moment seems to be a problem mainly centered around Ethereum, we
              believe most other turing-complete chains will experience the same
              issues once more use cases get adopted on top of them. The second
              problem stays mostly within Ethereum, which is the network’s usage
              being already close to maximum capacity. It simply does not seem
              feasible to use the network for all of the decentralized finance
              applications. Ethereum’s market cap is a tenth of that of Bitcoin.
              If the system is already near capacity, it’s hard to see how it
              can manage the capacity of becoming a true DeFi network for the
              rest of the ecosystem. Something Vitalik Buterin has acknowledged
              in an interview: tab.

            <p>
              The cryptocurrency market as a whole is difficult to predict. Most
              of the coins have become valueless, and it remains to be seen how
              the system will sustain itself after cash runs out from many of
              the major ICOs. Despite this, our outlook on Bitcoin specifically
              is extremely optimistic. Over the last year, through market
              volatility, including instability in traditional financial
              markets, Bitcoin has retained its value, demonstrated its
              impermeability to attack and hackers, and gained increasing
              respect from traditional financial players. Bitcoin is
              increasingly being seen as a store of value, and it is perceived
              as the standard by which other cryptocurrencies are measured.
              While people’s portfolios vary widely, Bitcoin remains the
              standard currency that almost every crypto investor holds as a
              major part of their holdings. The tremendous community and
              ecosystem around Bitcoin bode well for its long-term viability as
              a store of value. For that reason, creating decentralized
              financial services around Bitcoin represents a tremendous
              opportunity that has yet been untapped, partially because of the
              difficulty of creating smart contracts that work with the Bitcoin
              network, and partially because of the fractalization of the
              development community to many side projects. We believe this
              tendency of the development community to jump on the newest
              developments has drawn attention away from the real story: Bitcoin
              is here to stay. Thus, we believe, building a DeFi Blockchain on
              top of Bitcoin would bring the best out of both worlds: Bitcoin’s
              stability and immutability and DeFi-chain’s scalability and
              functionality. Building on Top of Bitcoin One of the major
              challenges in new blockchains is creating the robust immutability
              available after a critical mass of users and blocks secure the
              chain. To provide immediate security and immutability of the
              blockchain, DeFiChain will be anchoring itself to the bitcoin
              blockchain. Every few minutes, DeFiChain saves its most recent
              Merkle tree to the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to how Rootstock
              (Turing Complete Smart contracts secured by Bitcoin
              https://www.rsk.co/) is planning on connecting to Bitcoin. In this
              fashion, the most recent chain is always fully secure and
              immutable, and can be checked against the most recent record
              anchored to Bitcoin. Over time, DeFiChain will space out the
              anchors at larger intervals. This anchoring mechanism ensures
              provably immutable records from day one and defends against
              attacks, hackers and vulnerabilities that can cause concern in
              emerging chains. At the same time DeFiChain keeps its own
              consensus mechanism and function set, allowing for all those
              characteristics that Bitcoin does not inherently have. This is
              achieved by DeFiChain being a dedicated non-Turing-complete
              blockchain, designed specifically for the decentralized finance
              (DeFi) industry built on top of Bitcoin. DeFiChain provides full
              functionality for this specific segment of the DLT community,
              sacrificing other types of functionality for simplicity, rapid
              throughput and security. DeFiChain utilizes a completely
              decentralized Proof-of-Stake mechanism allowing for: a massive
              scalable and energy conserving consensus. fast transactions and
              high security ability to create a variety of DeFi apps based on
              one chain, rapidly and with very low attack surface multi-token
              support on one chain through decentralized wrapped token
              technology. decentralized governance independence of other
              financial systems and financial instruments. fully liquid
              investments with no minimum size of investments, and no minimum
              lock-up periods Unlike Ethereum or other turing-complete
              blockchains, DeFiChain is not a general-purpose blockchain, and
              commands outside the basic set of functions are not allowed.
              Limiting the allowed commands on purpose provides a dramatically
              reduced attack surface for smart contracts, eliminating the
              obvious breaches that are made possible when programmers need to
              design complex coding for these functions. The details of these
              will be described in the next section. Benefits of DeFiChain:
              Summary Development of a variety of financial operations &
              vehicles for cryptocurrency economy. High throughput for all
              transactions Safer, more secure blockchain specifically for
              decentralized finance.. Rapid development of dApps for
              decentralized finance. Peace of mind that the blockchain is not
              used for any types of non-financial dApps, thus decisions of
              Foundation and core developers are focused 100% on decentralized
              financial use-cases and nothing else. Rapid development of dApps
              with dedicated calls specifically for finance applications.
              Minimal attack surface of financial smart contracts developed on
              the platform. Reliable governance (off-chain and on-chain). Highly
              immutable – by periodic anchoring to Bitcoin blockchain. Initial
              dAppSets The initial function set includes: Decentralized lending
              Decentralized wrapping of tokens Decentralized pricing oracles
              Decentralized exchanges Transferable debts and receivables
              Decentralized non-collateralized debt Asset tokenization
              Distribution of dividends This chapter provides an overview of
              each of these functions and the following chapter covers the
              technical details in how this is achieved. Decentralized Lending
              Decentralized lending allows individuals and groups to borrow and
              lend without the intervention of a bank. Through collateralized
              systems, decentralized lending on Ethereum reached over a quarter
              of a billion dollars in 2018. All of these systems are based on
              Ethereum, meaning they are addressing only 15% of the market based
              on market capitalization. The DeFi platform will be addressing the
              entire 100% of the market by leading with Bitcoin, but also
              including the entire market through wrapping and pooling as
              described below. The major decentralized lending platforms
              (Compound, Dharma, dYdX, and Maker) provide lending at rates
              ranging from 0.5% through 6%. Because everything is managed
              through smart contracts, the overhead of banks is eliminated, and
              the platforms are able to provide much better rates than banks. As
              these types of decentralized lending services become safer, it’s
              likely the market will also see an increase in peer-to-peer
              lending opportunities through dedicated applications. The power of
              decentralized lending lies in the market efficiencies available by
              eliminating the middlemen and administration involved in lending.
              Furthermore, with investors concerned about minimal or even
              negative interest rates, decentralized lending protects the
              investors from that potentiality, providing market rate interest
              while giving borrowers better rates than they can get in the
              existing financial markets. Given the magnitude of credit and the
              role it plays in the economy as a whole, decentralized lending
              offers the potential for many more initiatives to borrow money
              based on open markets and favorable conditions. Easier access to
              lending translates into a faster-growing economy. Initial
              implementations of decentralized lending are fully collateralized,
              and because of the volatility of cryptocurrency, most platforms
              require double or more collateral on loans. This allows people to
              take loans based on cryptocurrency they hold. They can manage
              their cash flow problems without having to sell their crypto
              holdings, and meanwhile get favorable conditions on the loan.
              Decentralized Wrapping of Tokens An important issue for DeFi is
              the ability to work with a variety of cryptoassets, directly,
              on-chain. While the transaction on the chain is done via the
              native $DFI coin, DeFiChain can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20, or
              any other cryptoasset through wrapping. Wrapping allows the
              utilization of any digital asset such that the underlying asset is
              maintained, but it can transact on a different blockchain.
              DeFiChain provides a decentralized wrapping mechanism which allows
              the owner of the crytpoasset to maintain pegging to the asset and
              utilize a trustless wrapping mechanism that does not rely on any
              third party as a guarantor of the wrapping or asset. The wrapped
              tokens can be easily exchanged for their original value on their
              respective blockchain. Creating a wrapped token on DeFiChain is a
              rewarded activity, such that there is incentive for cryptocurrency
              holders to create wrapped tokens on the DeFi network as a form of
              rewarded decentralized financial investment. Wrapping is a key
              capability of DeFi due to the need for interoperability of
              different types of cryptocurrencies and assets. To date, there are
              no interoperability standards between different currencies, and
              the only way to interoperate between currencies is by using
              wrapping or collateralization, which has to be provided by a third
              party. The entire point of decentralization is that people do not
              need to trust an authority, yet, today that is the main way that
              investors can interoperate between Bitcoin and Ethereum without
              converting from one coin to the other. The Polkadot protocol
              provides a platform for the development of interoperable apps, but
              not specifically for DeFi. As a new protocol, it is yet to be seen
              how it will be leveraged. Without wrapping, holders would need to
              convert their cryptoasset to the DeFi currency in order to use the
              services offered. Obviously, for most investors, that’s
              unacceptable. The investor has put their money into Bitcoin, or
              Ethereum, or whatever else, because that is the currency they want
              to hold. The main purpose of DeFiChain is to enable financial
              transactions in any type of crypto asset, such that people can use
              the assets and coins they hold, as currency for investment in
              other types of financial vehicles. The decentralized wrapping
              function is crucial in allowing people to hold any asset and
              perform investments in another currency. So, for example, someone
              holding Bitcoin could make a loan to someone who wants to borrow
              ETH, or someone who wants to hedge against the cryptocurrency they
              have could do so using a wrapping function to use some of their
              assets to purchase options in other types of assets. Decentralized
              Pricing Oracles DeFiChain will include pricing oracles to collect
              data from outside blockchains. Oracles are used to collect data
              such as pricing of other cryptoassets4. Oracles are an important
              way for blockchains to collect accurate information from both
              other blockchains and from non-crypto markets5. Participating as
              an oracle allows earning of tokens based on the accuracy of the
              oracles. The built-in oracle function will allow smart contracts
              to determine the number of oracles, consensus percentage, and the
              parameters for rewarding oracles for the data they provide.
              Oracles are eventually meant to be decentralized. However,
              DeFiChain will be launched with a few appointed trusted pricing
              oracles that periodically submit pricing data from trusted source
              onto DeFiChain. Decentralized Exchanges The decentralized exchange
              function will allow atomic swap of cryptocurrencies in a
              peer-to-peer fashion6. The decentralized exchange function matches
              people for trading directly, without the need to buy and sell
              currency through an exchange. Using decentralized exchange reduces
              the risks associated with using exchanges, and ensures that the
              cryptoasset doesn’t leave the custodianship of the token-holders.
              It also removes the risk of custodianship from the exchange
              itself, because the mechanism is peer-to-peer based on an
              agreed-upon price or on the market price at the time of the
              exchange. While a number of decentralized exchanges are available
              on the market today7, DeFiChain solution allows integration of
              atomic swap capabilities in third-party applications by creating a
              decentralized exchange as a service. Transferable Debts and
              Receivables DeFiChain will offer a set of calls to work with
              transferable debts and receivables. In the centralized finance
              world, debts and accounts receivable can only be managed through
              financial institutions that handle loans. The lack of transparency
              of these transferable debts was one of the factors leading to the
              financial crisis of 2008. For small and medium enterprises, this
              can be a particularly powerful tool. For example, Jane’s widget
              factory supplies widgets to a large car manufacturer, but the car
              manufacturer pays for those widgets on a basis of invoice +60.
              Meanwhile, Jane has to pay for the materials to produce the
              widgets, and, of course, regular salaries to her workers on a
              monthly or weekly basis. The car manufacturer will pay the
              invoice, but not in time for Jane to pay all of her expenses.
              Without DeFi, Jane needs to go to the bank and pay whatever
              interest rates they demand, because she has no alternatives. The
              transferable receivables function would allow anyone to offer Jane
              a loan based on the receivables. Since many people would be able
              to see that the car manufacturer is a low-risk customer, and that
              they will pay their invoices, anyone who wants can make an offer
              to Jane for a better rate than the bank, creating a competitive
              market for debts and receivables based on the real risk and market
              assessment of that risk. Jane now can get a loan with great rates,
              and the lenders, likewise get excellent returns on their loans,
              despite the fact that they are loaning the money for only 30-60
              days. Blockchain adds transparency to the exchange of debts and
              loans based on receivables or other types of financial promises.
              DeFiChain will include the capability for organizations to create
              smart contracts that allow straightforward investment in such
              assets, so that peer-to-peer loans can be made without the need
              for a financial institution to guarantee these types of financial
              assets. Decentralized Non-Collateralized Debt In the future, it
              will be possible to provide non-collateralized loans based on the
              reputation and other factors about borrowers. Through different
              forms of verifiable credentials, and records of an individual’s
              borrowing and repayment history, non-collateralized systems can be
              developed. Many of the identity solutions being developed today
              are looking at anonymous and pseudonymous reputation-reporting
              systems, based on a Decentralized Identifier (DID) issued by the
              individual, and Verifiable Credentials (VC) issued by known
              authorities who are reputable to provide information about the
              individual’s credit history. The appropriate reputation based
              systems and risk assessment systems will need to be built out.
              While this will take time, perhaps years, it is foreseeable that
              this kind of system could supplement or replace today’s credit
              ratings scores. Another potential application of this feature
              would be the ability to create non-collateralized decentralized
              stablecoins. The success of DAI and MakerDAO show the desirability
              of pegged stablecoins, yet the high level of collateralization is
              a deterrent to creating more such projects. It is feasible that
              through market mechanisms and staking, decentralized
              non-collateralized stablecoins can be created. Asset Tokenization
              Asset tokenization is the representation of an asset, such as real
              estate or company equity, in immutable tokens on the blockchain8.
              This particular area of decentralized finance has tremendous
              potential and is one of the most exciting areas of investment for
              holders of cryptocurrency9. While several attempts have been made
              at asset tokenization in the blockchain space, most of them have
              pivoted and now provide services not directly related to asset
              tokenization (LAtoken, Etherparty). Tokeny and Tokenize-IT
              advertise themselves as tokenization platforms, but as of the
              writing of this paper, their processes are still fairly manual,
              and are heavily reliant on specific localities and regulatory
              requirements for those specific jurisdictions. Other blockchains,
              such as Tezos, have been mentioned as good platforms for asset
              tokenization, but, as with other multi-use blockchains, the
              Turing-complete set of commands will create complex smart
              contracts that are unnecessary when using DeFiChain. DeFiChain
              will provide a module specifically designed for asset
              tokenization, and will be particularly easy to use to tokenize
              assets such as company equity, real estate, and other valued
              holdings. Recently (October 2019), the Lichtenstein Blockchain law
              created the legal basis upon which any asset can be tokenized and
              legally bound to tokens or “containers” that represent the right
              to the asset. The law is precise in its wording, describing how a
              container issued by a trusted party now can hold the legal rights
              to the disposal over the asset. Disposal over the asset is
              distinct from ownership or rights to the asset, or even control as
              a specific concept. The careful wording of this law is a
              breakthrough for everyone in the world of asset tokenization,
              because it will now allow someone to go to a court of law with a
              token and expect to have legal legitimacy for assets that are
              tokenized (as long as the authority granting the token is
              recognized as a trusted authority to do so). It also opens up a
              space for DeFiChain to apply for this trusted status, such that
              the Asset Tokenization capability described here can be offered as
              a decentralized, legal and authorized capability that people can
              trust, without having to depend on any centralized authority. For
              more information on this law, please see Liechtenstein’s website
              at
              https://liechtensteinusa.org/article/liechtensteins-parliament-approves-blockchain-act-unanimously
              Examples of assets people can now tokenize using the blockchain:
              Securities, such as ETF investing, stocks and shares. Shares in
              privately held companies. Energy and income generating devices,
              such as wind turbines, solar farms, satellites. Ownership in food
              means of production (new forms of cooperative farms where
              non-farmers could own food supply instead of commodities traded on
              exchanges) Self-driving cars, vending machines, ATMs, pinball
              machines, and other types of revenue-generating self-regulating
              devices. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Small real
              estate investments (time shares, short-term rental apartments,
              etc.) Large real estate investments (airports, amusement parks,
              apartment complexes, business parks) Distribution of Dividends Any
              tokenized asset with return on investment can use the dividends
              distribution module to create smart contracts that pay out returns
              on the investment automatically. Using DeFiChain will allow a leap
              in the functionality of dividends distribution. It will be
              possible to implement models similar to today, where payouts are
              performed on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, or models
              where payouts are on a daily, hourly or even minute-by-minute
              basis. Distribution of dividends would be relevant in any type of
              tokenized asset, as described above. For example, today, a
              municipal government might do a bond issue to invest in a wind
              turbine to supply electricity. The government would take care of
              everything, and repay that bond according to the schedule. With
              distribution of dividends, the community could purchase the wind
              turbine directly, and distribute the dividends to the investors in
              the wind turbine. Instead of going through the administration
              required through the centralized authority (government), every
              citizen who wanted to could invest in that wind turbine, and
              dividends would be paid according to each person’s contribution to
              that investment. Eliminating overhead and fair distribution of
              profits would be major benefits for the community owning the wind
              turbine. In this case, the wind turbine is a public good, but it
              could also simply be a private investment. Any private investment
              could be run this way: a pinball machine, self-driving taxi, real
              estate investment, etc. Automatic distribution of dividends
              reduces the need for administration and overhead, as well as
              eliminating uncertainty about payouts and control by a centralized
              authority. The need for joint dividend investing is becoming
              increasingly relevant with IoT. Devices are able to create
              tremendous value. A self-driving car will be able to provide taxi
              services. Vending machines, sensors, satellites, etc., are all
              potentially revenue-generating devices that people can own
              together and share in the profit of together, yet until now the
              legal and financial complexity of doing so has been prohibitive.
              DeFi can simplify those processes. Similarly, distribution of
              profits for a private company can be implemented. One of the first
              experiments in this area is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous
              Organization) called dOrg. dOrg is a collection of programmers (as
              well as a sales/operations team) who co-own their software house.
              Distribution of salaries is through a DAO that functions as a
              multi-sig, such that every 2 weeks, the whole organization submits
              their payment requests for work contracted, and the team votes to
              pass one anothers’ salary requests. Inside dOrg, each person holds
              a “reputation” that represents the percentage of ownership each
              person has earned (they earn ownership according to the amount of
              work done since the inception of the company). But what will
              happen to the profit at the end of the year? Presumably, each
              individual will have to submit a request for their percentage of
              the profits, and everyone will have to vote on that, too, because
              the DAO does not allow for automated distribution of profits.
              Using DeFiChain, the team could easily implement a quarterly or
              annual function that would automatically distribute the profits of
              the company to each person, according to their holdings in the
              company. This scheme would work even for people who were active in
              the past, but are no longer active, so they aren’t in the DAO any
              longer, but they still hold a percentage based on their past
              contributions. Other contributors might be an investor who puts
              money into the company, but does not participate. The examples
              above seem logical and straightforward, but today are extremely
              time-consuming and complex. People who want to make an investment
              together in companies, real estate, or other income-deriving
              assets type of dividend distribution today is complex and requires
              a lot of manual calculations. Through the DeFi Distribution of
              Dividends functionality, it becomes not just simple, but automatic
              for companies to distribute dividends to equity owners. DeFiChain
              Design Design Parameters Looking at the business requirements from
              the chapter before, DeFiChain needs to meet the following
              requirements: Robust and secure: built on a proven and secure
              blockchain. Fast and scalable. Includes decentralized consensus
              mechanism. Provides extensible smart contract support, without a
              Turing-complete instruction set. As immutable as possible (Block
              anchoring enabled.) . Each of these design principles is described
              in detail below. 1. Robust and Secure Bitcoin Core is the most
              robust and longest running blockchain in the world. It has been
              operating with no disruptions since the genesis block in January
              2009. Furthermore, from a security standpoint, Bitcoin core has
              proven itself to be most secure blockchain with no security
              incidents, while securing the crypto asset with the highest
              valuation in the world, that is, Bitcoin (BTC). As of this
              writing, Bitcoin Core successfully secures $150 billion worth of
              crypto assets, or 68% of the crypto asset market capitalization.
              The proven security and robustness of the Bitcoin Core made it the
              blockchain of choice for DeFiChain base for extension. DeFiChain
              is built based on a fork of Bitcoin Core 0.18, specifically
              v0.18.1. DeFiChain will be written in C++, and the plan is to use
              other languages, such as Rust, in the future. While DeFiChain is a
              new blockchain, basing it on a Bitcoin Core fork results in a
              chain that is easy to integrate with for exchanges and apps that
              support Bitcoin. 2. Fast and Scalable One of the proven
              disadvantages of the Bitcoin blockchain has been the slowness of
              transactions on the chain. Furthermore, scalability has become an
              issue as the number of blocks on the chain increase. In order to
              implement a blockchain with the required speed and scalability,
              DeFiChain fork of Bitcoin Core will include the following
              improvements: Block time: 30 seconds Block size: 16 MB These
              improvements provide a transaction rate of over 2,200 transactions
              per second (tps) while maintaining manageable compute and
              bandwidth requirements to allow for decentralized operations of
              DeFiChain. The following table compares Bitcoin and its forks, as
              well as Ethereum, to DeFiChain performance: 3. Decentralized
              Consensus Mechanism Bitcoin Core is using Proof-of-Work (PoW) as
              the consensus mechanism. DeFiChain leverages the best aspects of
              PoW, that is, using hashing of the staking node’s ID for block
              creation while focusing the majority of the consensus on
              Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The major improvement in the PoW mechanism
              for DeFiChain is that staking nodes can run without investing in
              high-end servers and ultra-fast bandwidth connections. Thus,
              DeFiChain is creating the potential for easier and faster
              decentralization of the mode ownership and infrastructure. 4.
              Non-Turing-complete Smart Contracts Decentralized financial
              transactions are implemented through smart contracts. For example
              to ensure that borrowers repay lenders, smart contracts implement
              the conditions of lending in the code. For smart contract
              development, DeFiChain will be adding opcode support for
              decentralized financial instruction sets. The DeFi opcode
              complements and works in tangent with the Script scripting
              language of the existing Bitcoin Core protocol. The DeFi scripting
              language is called Recipe, denoting the language’s role in
              describing and allowing for decentralized financial contracts.
              Bitcoin Script instruction words usually start with the prefix
              OP_*. Recipe instruction words carry the prefix DF_*. 5. Immutable
              through Block Anchoring While the common discussion of
              immutability is a binary conversation (a blockchain is either
              immutable or not), in fact, immutability is on a spectrum. The
              level of immutability of a blockchain is related to the cost of a
              rollback or “fork out” of mined blocks, also known as a 51%
              attack. It takes time to amass significant miners or minters to
              make 51% attack costly enough that it is generally regarded as
              immutable, meaning that a new blockchain is automatically at a
              disadvantage when it comes to the immutability of the records.
              Some newer blockchains have been taking shortcuts to increase its
              immutability quality, typically by compromising on
              decentralization. For example, the chains may allow only delegated
              stakers chosen by the founders, or by making the blockchain
              permissioned instead of permissionless. DeFiChain aims to maintain
              decentralization quality while maintaining immutability. To do so,
              DeFiChain will anchor its block to Bitcoin blockchain every few
              blocks. This further enhances the immutability of DeFiChain
              without any compromise to the decentralized nature of the chain.
              Consensus Algorithm Proof-of-Stake DeFiChain utilizes a
              Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm similar to Bitcoin Core’s original
              Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm. While DeFiChain is choosing
              PoS over PoW, at the same time, DeFi technology retains the best
              of the tested and proven technologies that were developed in the
              Bitcoin Core blockchain. Masternodes for Staking To run a
              masternode (staking node), stakers must hold a fixed amount of
              20,000 DFI. Masternodes on DeFiChain participate in active
              transaction validations and block creations. The staking amount is
              intended to be lowered with the stability and maturity of
              blockchain to encourage further decentralization. Each staking
              node can perform only 1 hash per second, with the nonce from
              Bitcoin Core PoW algorithm replaced by a staker’s masternode ID. A
              new block is mined if it satisfies the following condition:
              SHA256({staker’s UTXO}, {current timestamp, in seconds}, {stake
              modifier}) < {target} The stakers check this requirement each
              second. If the block condition is less than the current target,
              then the stakers assemble and sign a new block. Staker’s UTXO
              require 20 confirmations before it can be accepted as a stake.
              Stake Modifier A stake modifier is a collective source of random
              entropy. Without a stake modifier, the future PoS kernel would be
              completely predictable. A good stake modifier needs to be neither
              predictable nor influance-able by stakers. DeFiChain’s staker
              modifier is set to be SHA256({previous stake modifier},
              {masternode ID}). Validation of Future and Past Headers Unlike
              PoW, block header validation requires a stakes table. Headers get
              verified in batches before full blocks are downloaded, so the
              stakes table is used to verify future stakes. To be able to verify
              future headers, the blockchain needs to apply an additional rule,
              so any change of the stakes database gets written right away, but
              takes effect only after 300 blocks. As a result, any node will be
              able to verify any block header against its current stake, if a
              block header isn’t further in the future (or in the past) than 300
              blocks. Nothing at Stake Protection For PoS blockchains, there’s
              no limit to how many conflicting blocks a staker may sign. As a
              result, stakers may stake for every possible fork or branch, which
              weakens the finality of a PoS blockchain. This problem is known as
              a double-sign and is not possible in PoW blockchains, where a
              miner cannot mine all the possible branches without splitting
              mining capability. In PoW, this represents an intrinsic economic
              penalty. However, PoS blockchains cannot apply an inherent
              economic penalty for signing conflicting blocks on different
              branches. Therefore, in order to enhance the finality of
              DeFiChain, in PoS, it’s necessary to detect double-signs and
              penalize them through an explicit mechanism. Detection of
              Double-sign Each block header has a sequence number as a number of
              blocks that a particular staker has mined before a particular
              block. If two blocks are mined with the same sequence number, it
              means that a staker has double-signed, even if the blocks have
              different ancestors, i.e. across branches. During a block’s
              generation, a staker has the right to include the double-sign
              proofs into his block header in exchange for only half of the
              penalty. Double-sign Penalty To be able to apply a penalty to
              stakers who double-sign, DeFiChain has to disallow immediate
              withdrawing of stake. Thus, when a deactivation transaction is
              confirmed, DeFiChain requires 3000 blocks to pass. At a block time
              of 30 seconds, 3000 blocks is equivalent to 25 hours. The
              double-sign penalty is 10 times the block rewards, deducted from
              the collateral. This also disqualifies the stakers from further
              staking immediately. The staker who wants to get back to staking
              has to deposit a fresh stake UTXO of 20,000 DFI. Running the
              official DeFiChain node does not cause any unintentional or
              accidental double-sign. Double-sign happens only in cases of
              malicious intent. Time Drift Attack The chain uses a maximum
              future block time of only approx. 5 seconds, to protect the chain
              from time drift attacks, where stakers set a block time too far
              ahead in the future, in order to claim a reward for themselves.
              DeFi also uses NTP time synchronization to allow for ongoing
              adjustment to the block time. Bitcoin Anchoring DeFiChain stakers
              publish blockchain block hashes periodically to the Bitcoin
              blockchain, providing public audit and block anchoring of
              DeFiChain to the strongest, most secure blockchain in the world.
              Every 60 blocks (approximately 30 minutes), a staker gets the
              right to write the Merkle root of the previous block onto the
              Bitcoin blockchain. The information written is, specifically, the
              txid of the Bitcoin transaction, Bitcoin block header and Merkle
              proof containing the Merkle root onto the newly mined block. By
              doing so, the staker will be rewarded an extra block reward in
              DFI, incentivising nodes to regularly anchor all records to the
              Bitcoin blockchain.
