              We are excited to announce that Binance France has been granted a
              Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) registration by the Autorité
              des marchés financiers (AMF) with the approval of the Autorité de
              Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR). This milestone
              achievement represents Binance’s first DASP in Europe and
              demonstrates our commitment to being a compliance-first exchange.
              The AMF regulates and safeguards the French financial markets and
              ensures financial literacy among investors. The ACPR is an
              independent authority monitoring banks and insurance companies in
              France. With the approval and under the supervision of AMF and
              ACPR, this DASP registration will allow Binance France to operate
              in France. Compliance and regulation are critical factors for the
              success of the crypto and blockchain industry. Over the years,
              Binance has taken measures to ensure compliance, including growing
              our international compliance team and advisory board, as well as
              actively helping to fight fraud and ransomware. We are pleased
              that our efforts have paid off, and meet stringent French
              compliance standards to successfully obtain the DASP registration.
              Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder and CEO of Binance, said: “Effective
              regulation is essential for the mainstream adoption of
              cryptocurrency. The French DASP and AML/CFT regulations put in
              place stringent anti-money laundering and fit and proper
              requirements to meet the high standards necessary to be regulated
              in France. We are grateful to the AMF and ACPR, who demonstrated a
              commitment to innovation that made it possible for Binance to
              navigate the entire application process. Since day one, Binance
              has always put its users first, and now the crypto community can
              have even further confidence in Binance France as a trusted DASP
              registered in France.” As the first major global crypto exchange
              to register in France, we will be able to bring cryptocurrency
              services and education to millions. David Princay, CEO of Binance
              France, commented: “The registration of Binance France as a DASP
              is a key milestone for crypto in Europe. In particular, the new
              levels of protection for AML will help grow crypto adoption in
              France and Europe. Greater adoption will help bring better
              liquidity to the market, which will be welcomed by users and the
              community in particular.” What’s Next? Binance will significantly
              scale our operations in France to make crypto and our services
              more accessible to all. In line with our mission to be the
              infrastructure services provider for the blockchain ecosystem, we
              have plans to expand our team to pursue further infrastructure
              development.

              In the past week, it’s been difficult to escape the UST/LUNA
              crash. In fact, every interview I participated in revolved to some
              extent around the situation. To clarify my thoughts on the topic,
              I’ve collected my answers together, including my views, lessons
              learned, spillover effects, systematic risks, resilience,
              regulations, and more. The UST/LUNA incident was a regrettable one
              that affected many people. At Binance, our first focus is always
              to protect affected users. Sadly, there are no great solutions
              here that can please everyone. Many proposals were discussed in
              the community. Unfortunately, each had its drawbacks. I voiced my
              opinions about the incident openly on Twitter. Binance has also
              volunteered to let the Terra project team focus on helping the
              retail guys first before us. There Are Many Lessons to Be Learned
              Here Let’s take a look at the design flaws. Theoretically
              speaking, when you peg to one asset using a different asset as
              collateral, there will always be a chance for under
              collateralization or depegging. Even if it is over collateralized
              by 10x, the collateral asset can crash more than 10x. Nothing is
              100% stable (relative to something else) in this world. The most
              stupid design flaw is thinking that minting more of an asset will
              increase its total value (market cap). Printing money does not
              create value; it just dilutes existing holders. Exponentially
              minting LUNA made the problem a lot worse. Whoever designed this
              should have their head checked. The other fundamental flaw was the
              over-aggressive incentives. Specifically, Anchor’s 20% fixed APY
              to push for (in-organic) growth. Let’s strip away all the fluffy
              stuff and look at fundamentals. You can use incentives to attract
              users to your ecosystem. But eventually, you need to generate
              “income” to sustain it, i.e., more revenue than the expenses.
              Otherwise, you will run out of money and crash. However, in this
              case, the “income” concept is confused as the project team
              probably included their own token sales or appreciation in the
              value of LUNA as “income”. This approach is flawed. People come in
              because of the incentives, yes, and the valuation of LUNA goes up.
              And more incentives are given out to more people. But you haven’t
              created any value yet. High APYs Don’t Necessarily Mean Healthy
              Projects It’s now obvious that the whole thing was built on a
              self-perpetuating, shallow concept. While Terra did have an
              ecosystem with some use cases, the speed of growth of the
              ecosystem did not match the speed of the incentives used to
              attract new users. The growth was “hollow”. Eventually, the bubble
              burst, and here we are. Key lesson: don’t just chase high APY.
              Look at fundamentals. Where Attempting to Restore the Peg Went
              Wrong The Terra team was slow in using their reserves to restore
              the peg. The entire incident may have been avoided if they had
              used their reserves when the de-peg was at 5%. After the value of
              the coins had already crashed by 99% (or $80 billion), they tried
              to use $3 billion to do the rescue. Of course, this didn’t work.
              In this case, it didn’t look like a scam. It was just (sorry for
              the lack of a more polite word) stupid. Lesson two: always be
              operationally extremely responsive. The Terra team was also very
              slow and infrequent in their communication with the community,
              which further eroded any lingering trust users had with them.
              Lesson three: always communicate frequently with your users,
              especially in times of crisis. Lastly, I have mixed feelings about
              the revival plans provided by the Terra team. But as I said,
              regardless of my personal feelings, we will be here to support the
              community’s decision. Will There Be Spillover Effects? Yes, of
              course. There have already been shockwaves sent throughout the
              entire crypto ecosystem. USDT de-pegged to 0.96 for a bit but
              recovered quickly. Many crypto projects were and are still
              negatively impacted in many ways. If nothing else, most crypto
              prices dropped. Even bitcoin dropped about 20%. Many people
              withdrew their funds from high APY projects. But if you think
              about it, this may not be a bad thing in the long run. Some shocks
              are good for building a solid foundation. Some solid projects
              actually “benefited” in a way. BUSD went to 1.1 in pegging and saw
              an inflow of funds over the last weeks. Resilience Is Present in
              the Crypto Ecosystem Honestly, I am pleased by the resilience the
              crypto industry has shown. The combined size of UST and LUNA was
              bigger than Lehman Brothers when it failed. Bitcoin only dropped
              roughly 20% from $40,000 to $30,000. This sometimes happens even
              when there is only positive news for bitcoin. Overall, most other
              projects stood up fine. One thing that’s hard for people who are
              used to centralized systems to understand about decentralized
              systems is their resilience. In a centralized system, all the
              banks operate similarly (the regulations require them to do so).
              They all take reserves from a central bank, and when one bank
              fails, it has a spillover effect on all the other banks. In a
              decentralized system, all the stablecoins work in different ways.
              There are no common standards or reserves. However, when one
              fails, the others are less affected. Even without bailouts, all
              other major stablecoins withstood the shock, and most other crypto
              projects are fine. Will Regulators Toughen Their Stance on Stable
              Coins given This Incident? I don’t know what each regulator thinks
              or will do. So far, I have seen mostly encouraging responses from
              the few who regularly keep in touch with me. Of course, this is a
              biased selection as the people who keep in close contact with me
              are mostly very crypto-friendly. I do believe we need more
              guidelines around how stable coins should be regulated. But one
              regulator said it best: “We definitely need to pay more attention
              to algorithmic stablecoins, but let’s not let one failed company
              kill the entire industry. We should continue to push forward.” How
              Do We Avoid Systematic Risks like These in the Future? This is the
              trillion-dollar question. I don’t think there is an absolute
              answer here. Nothing is risk-free. The fiat currency you use today
              has its risks too. The oldest currency in use today is less than
              330 years old, the British pound. All the currencies before that
              are gone. We could ban or shut down everything, but that would
              also kill innovation. To prevent bank failure and mismanagement,
              we don’t shut down all banks. At the end of the day, there are
              several things you can do to reduce systematic risk. As an
              investor, diversify your portfolio. Don’t put all your savings in
              one coin because it offers a high APY (Annual Percentage Yield).
              In fact, stay away from super high APY investments. Those hardly
              last. High APY = high risk. Most importantly, educate yourself.
              Learn about financial literacy every day. Visit Binance Academy
              and explore everything it has to offer (sorry, I have to do a bit
              of sales here). As an industry, we are resilient. While instances
              like the one with LUNA and UST are regrettable, we are committed
              to playing a crucial part in building a sustainable, enriching
              blockchain ecosystem for all.

              Due to the influx of NFT users, NFT projects have turned to a
              strategy called “whitelisting” to grant presale minting access to
              only pre-approved crypto addresses. Whitelisting is beneficial to
              both projects and users as it helps mitigate fraud and avoid gas
              wars. Criteria for whitelisting approval varies from platform to
              platform, although some requirements are more transparent than
              others, like Binance NFT. Sign up for a Binance account today to
              participate in a fair NFT whitelisting process and enjoy the
              benefits of being whitelisted. Want to participate? Read on to
              find out how NFT whitelisting works and the steps you can take to
              increase your chances of being whitelisted. Disclaimer: Being
              whitelisted does not guarantee profits. NFTs are an emerging asset
              class that is still evolving. The information in this article
              should not be construed as investment or financial advice. Always
              do your own research before making any decision to buy, sell, or
              trade NFTs. What is NFT Whitelisting? NFTs (non-fungible tokens)
              are constantly evolving, encapsulating proof-of-ownership for
              assets as far-reaching as digital art, metaverse land sales, NFT
              gaming items, and even physical items. With such a wide cast of
              use cases, it's no wonder that the NFT phenomenon has become such
              a popular area within the crypto space. Many new and existing NFT
              projects have active and engaged communities looking to secure the
              latest NFT drop from their favorite projects. For some projects,
              it's vital that the newest release is democratic and accessible to
              all, and one of the fairest ways to do this is through a process
              called whitelisting. Whitelisting allows NFT projects to offer
              their communities the opportunity to mint an NFT sale prior to its
              public minting or sale. Why are NFT whitelists used? Projects
              practice NFT whitelisting for three main reasons: rewarding early
              supporters, preventing gas wars, and guarding against spam.
              Rewarding early supporters What the whitelist provides is a means
              for a smaller group of the community to have early access to an
              upcoming NFT release. Some projects may be releasing free NFTs and
              exclusive content to whitelisted users, while others could be
              allowing presale access at discounted rates; all whitelist offers
              vary depending on the NFT project. The requirements for whitelist
              registration also vary from project to project. Some may require a
              range of tasks to be completed or a minimum wallet hold of that
              particular project's asset. There is no standardized process for
              whitelisting; some projects may even grant pre-approval if you are
              actively participating in community events and chats, with no
              formal submission needed. Preventing gas wars Since public NFT
              sales don’t require whitelisting, a high number of users
              interacting with the smart contract simultaneously can cause
              transaction fees to rise significantly. This happens when users
              compete to get their minting transactions approved first, driving
              up gas costs and leading to what we call “gas wars”. In contrast,
              whitelist registration allows only a selected number of wallet
              addresses to mint the NFT before the public sale, which means the
              sale is less likely to experience network congestion and gas wars.
              Another of the most effective ways whitelists avoid gas issues is
              by determining a specific timeframe within which NFTs can be
              minted. It’s worth noting that the gas price will vary depending
              on the blockchain network traffic as a whole. Sometimes, a
              whitelist sale can be affected by other minting sales or external
              events. A favorable addition to the whitelist concept for NFT
              projects is that if there is a huge demand to join the whitelist,
              it creates hype and buzz around the release, project, and
              potential subsequent releases. For more information on gas fees on
              Binance NFT, check out our guide on What are the NFT Transaction
              Fees on Binance. Combating spam By establishing whitelisted users,
              projects can prevent spam from non-whitelisted addresses. In
              addition, the whitelisting process ensures that mass account
              registrations are not allowed. Preventing spam accounts from
              accessing presale minting is essential as they may slow down
              network efficiency and inflate gas fees for users. Benefits of NFT
              whitelisting Access to NFTs before public launch While attracting
              many users is a sign of a successful NFT project, it also means
              that there will be more competition to mint NFTs. Whitelisted
              users often get priority or guaranteed access to mint NFTs,
              avoiding the competition, on-chain traffic, and soaring gas fees.
              For example, a project may allow only its whitelisted users to
              mint NFTs anytime within a predefined 48-hour period. As mentioned
              above, some projects may even offer exclusive NFTs as a token of
              appreciation for early supporters. Reduced risk of fraud One
              example of fraud is when someone repeatedly buys and sells their
              assets to inflate prices artificially. This practice, known as
              wash trading, is one of several tactics that bad actors use to
              manipulate the market. Since users typically have to pass
              whitelist criteria before being granted access to the NFT presale,
              theoretically, the risk of fraudulent behavior is reduced.
              Restricting the mint period can also prevent bad actors from
              attempting to monopolize the project’s NFT market. Caution against
              whitelisting While priority or early access to crypto may sound
              like a lucrative idea, users should note that being on a whitelist
              and minting presale NFTs does not guarantee profits. If you mint
              NFTs that are unpopular, they might just end up being illiquid
              assets that are difficult to sell on the secondary market.
              Remember to do your own research before minting and invest only
              what you are willing to lose. Given the volatility of the market,
              there is no way to accurately predict the demand of assets offered
              by new projects. How to get whitelisted in 3 steps 1. Find
              projects before they are launched The NFT market is brimming with
              potential projects hoping to attract new users. These new NFT
              projects may offer whitelist spots before their official public
              launch. In other words, to get whitelisted, you’ll need to be
              early. If you like seeking new opportunities and trying novel
              products, this should be right up your alley. However, if you are
              not an early adopter, you need to be aware of the risks involved
              as you are placing trust in a new project that has yet to prove
              itself. With NFT scams prevalent, it is advised to always do your
              own research before joining a whitelist. 2. Join Discord groups
              Once you have done your research and decided on a project, you
              will need to join the community by entering a project’s chat
              group. For NFT projects, Discord is the primary communication
              tool, followed by Twitter. Each Discord group may vary from
              project to project, but information about the whitelisting process
              is usually posted on the Announcements channel. If there isn’t any
              information there, explore the other channels of the Discord
              group. It is possible that you missed the whitelist period or that
              the project does not have a whitelist. Alternatively, ask other
              members of the group in the community chatting channel. Most
              projects have a general channel to facilitate conversations about
              the project or other general topics. 3. Apply to be on the
              whitelist Once you have done ample research on the project and
              whitelist criteria, it’s time to apply to be on one. Whitelist
              applications can range from filling out a simple Google Form to
              earning a spot by being an active referrer of their project. Some
              projects even use a lottery system in their whitelist process.
              Each project is unique and has its own rules governing its
              whitelist process. There is no guaranteed way to get on an NFT
              whitelist as requirements will differ. For instance,
              creator-focused projects may only select winners of an art contest
              to be on their whitelist. This unique selection process is why
              being connected and informed about new developments in Discord
              groups is beneficial to users hoping to get whitelisted.
              Sometimes, the selection process may not be entirely transparent.
              It’s important to only complete the tasks that you feel
              comfortable with. In case you’re discouraged about not getting
              accepted, remember that other projects in the market offer
              opportunities too. How to get whitelisted on Binance NFT It may be
              hard to successfully get whitelisted for other platforms or
              companies due to a lack of transparency regarding requirements.
              However, on Binance NFT, the selection criteria are transparent
              and fair, thanks to the Binance NFT Subscription Mechanism.
              Through the Subscription Mechanism, users can get exclusive access
              to the latest NFT sales, as long as they meet the NFT or BNB
              prerequisites. For example, certain sales might be exclusive to
              holders of certain NFTs, such as our recent Easter Subscription
              Mechanism sale. Conclusion As NFT continues to make waves, the
              competition to mint may be tough, depending on how popular the
              project is. If you’re interested in minting NFTs, consider
              applying to get whitelisted and increase your chances of a
              successful mint. As always, make sure to establish an NFT
              project’s reputability and take the time to research before making
              any trades.
