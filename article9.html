              Most people want to buy Bitcoin, which is basically why Bitcoin is
              one of the best cryptocurrencies for trading. Ethereum, Litecoin
              and other popular coins are also good options to use as a base
              currency. USDT is also one of the best coins for crypto trading
              today. It has the highest trading volume and high liquidity, so
              it's easy to use it for many trading pairs. Speaking of crypto
              pairs, the most popular are BTC/ETH, BTC/LTC, USDT/BTC and
              ETH/LTC, among others. Of course, when day trading cryptocurrency
              with leverage of up to 500x, you can make a profit with any
              trading pair. Don't forget that everything depends on what's going
              on that day! StormGain is part of a worldwide affiliate network
              called FPM.global, which allows users to generate revenue by
              driving traffic to the platform. It offers one of the highest
              CPA/revenue share offers for crypto traffic. In 2018, the
              project's ICO took place, and Theta Network was set up on the
              Ethereum blockchain. In March 2019, the Theta mainnet was launched
              on its own blockchain, and the TFUEL token was developed in the
              same year. May 2020 saw the start of the second version of the
              Theta mainnet. On 4 February 2021, the ThetaSwap DEX decentralised
              exchange was launched on the Theta blockchain. Mainnet 3.0 was
              launched on 30 June 2021. Theta Fuel's features The video
              streaming industry currently has a number of problems associated
              with the growth of both the volume of streamed videos and their
              resolution, as well as with the high degree of centralisation in
              this industry: Centralised Content Delivery Networks (CDN) receive
              a large percentage of the reward, while only a small fraction of
              it reaches platforms and video creators. Content Delivery Networks
              (CDN) has low reach. Buffering issues are common, and downloads
              are slow in remote locations. Due to the growing needs of viewers
              and video content providers, the existing infrastructure cannot
              cope with them in high-definition 4K and 8K streams. Theta Network
              allows users on Theta-enabled platforms to relay video streams
              they are watching to other viewers in their local area. For
              sharing video with their peers and contributing their bandwidth to
              the network, they receive rewards in TFUEL tokens. The
              peer-to-peer network delivers high-quality video to any location.
              This is possible because user devices (which act as caching nodes)
              are geographically located close to each other, in contrast to
              CDNs' data processing centres. The Theta blockchain uses a unique
              consensus mechanism called Multi Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PoS
              subtype). Unlike the simple BFT, it allows a much higher
              transaction speed. The Theta ecosystem includes the following
              members: Streamers are content creators who are rewarded in
              tokens. Viewers are users who consume video content. They receive
              tokens for watching videos and ads. Advertisers use the platform
              to advertise services and products to viewers. They use Theta
              tokens to pay for online advertising time and also sponsor
              streamers. Caching Nodes are computers and servers that provide
              caching services that improve video quality and speed up video
              delivery. These nodes are also rewarded in tokens. Ingest Nodes
              help provide different bitrates, stream resolution, etc. They also
              help caching nodes to broadcast live, for which they receive
              rewards. Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is an operational token on the Theta
              blockchain and is used as payment for video content relayers'
              work, for viewing video content, creating and interacting with
              smart contracts and THETA staking. The emission of TFUEL tokens is
              unlimited but will occur at a rate of no more than 5% of the total
              supply of tokens per year. Thus, TFUEL tokens are subject to
              inflation but at a relatively low rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              TFUEL's price history Theta Fuel token was launched in March 2019.
              The first major crypto exchange to list it was the South Korean
              Upbit, where TFUEL was traded in a pair with the South Korean won.
              Two months later, the token was listed by Binance. The token was
              launched during a bearish crypto market, so it should come as no
              surprise that the coin's price declined until early 2020. The
              crypto market began to recover in February 2020 but was
              interrupted by the collapse in March. On 13 March, TFUEL's price
              dropped to its all-time low. This was followed by a slow price
              recovery. In May 2020, amid the launch of the second version of
              the Theta mainnet, the price rose sharply, reaching a local high
              of $0.0243. That was followed by a correction, after which the
              price, despite fluctuations, moved sideways in the range of
              $0.008-$0.013. The sideways movement continued until December 2020
              and gave way to exponential growth. On 24 March 2021, the price
              rose to a local high of $0.57 and entered a correction that
              continued until the end of April. In May 2021, the price again
              experienced an increase, but, having reached a local high of
              $0.424, it dropped again to a local low of $0.145. That was
              followed by a sharp rise, during which the price reached its
              all-time high on 9 June 2021. After that, the token's price
              experienced several substantial fluctuations and a correction,
              leading it to start moving sideways in the range of $0.25-$0.40.
              Theta Fuel technical analysis The crypto market is
              unapologetically bearish, and so is TFUEL. The price has
              consistently traded lower after it peaked in late May 2021,
              creating an overwhelming bearish market structure and breaking
              through several key support zones. TFUEL is currently trading
              above a support zone at around $0.06 after the price recently
              rebounded from the support level. We don't expect a trend reversal
              at that point since there is still significant bearish pressure on
              the crypto market in general. The 50-day and 100-day Exponential
              Moving Averages (EMA) are also acting as dynamic resistance to
              price, which may also suggest that TFUEL will move lower in the
              coming weeks. Theta Fuel (TFUEL) price prediction 2021 In the
              absence of sharp fluctuations in the crypto market in the
              remaining weeks of the year, the price continued to consolidate
              lower and eventually closed the year at around $0.19. Theta Fuel
              (TFUEL) price prediction for 2022, 2023, 2025, 2030 As usual,
              we've compiled for you TFUEL crypto price predictions made by
              popular forecasting services. TradingBeasts' TFUEL price
              prediction for 2022, 2023, 2025, 2030 TradingBeasts believe that
              the price of TFUEL in the coming years will fluctuate in the range
              of $0.06-$0.20 and will be $0.16 at the end of 2025. Wallet
              Investor's TFUEL price prediction for 2022, 2023, 2025, 2030
              Wallet Investor is more pessimistic in its TFUEL price
              predictions. According to their calculations, the token's price
              will fall by over 95% in one year. That translates to a price drop
              to $0.00321 in 2023 and another -86.36% decline in 2024. Gov
              Capital's TFUEL price prediction for 2022, 2023, 2025, 2030 Gov
              Capital predicts a considerable rise in the token price in the
              coming years. They believe the price will rise to $0.42 in a year
              and to $3.01 in 5 years. CryptoPredictions' TFUEL price prediction
              for 2022, 2023, 2025, 2030 The young but nonetheless quite
              well-known website CryptoPredictions.com hasn't ignored TFUEL
              either. They suppose that the price of the token in 2022 will be
              stable and will move sideways in the range of $0.47-$0.48. In
              2023, the price will begin to decline slowly, and it will be
              $0.418 in December 2023. In 2024, the price will increase to reach
              $0.558 by the end of the year. In 2025, the price will experience
              a correction, but it will return to $0.558 at the end of the year.
              Theta Fuel (TFUEL) overall future value predictions The outlook
              for the project looks good. There are many signs that it will grow
              and evolve: Demand for streaming video is high and growing. The
              company's technical solutions distinguish it favourably from
              centralised competitors. A team of skilled developers is working
              on the project. The validators in Theta blockchain are such giants
              as Google, Sony, Samsung, Binance and others. At the same time,
              there are certain concerns associated with TFUEL trading volume.
              At the time of writing, more than 40% of the daily trading volume
              of the TFUEL token is on the relatively little-known Pionex
              exchange. This disproportion may be a sign that the token's price
              is being artificially manipulated. In addition, the initial
              distribution of the project's governing token, THETA, was quite
              centralised. And a high degree of centralisation can be a problem
              for a project that positions itself as decentralised. How high can
              Theta Fuel go? If the project can really compete with the
              centralised giants in the video streaming market, the price of the
              TFUEL token could reach $10. Theta Fuel (TFUEL) price prediction
              today In the near future, the most likely scenario is either a
              rebound that affects the market in general or a fall to the lower
              prices, and maybe a new all-time low. For its projects, Sky Mavis
              uses its proprietary Ronin blockchain, which is a sidechain of
              Ethereum. This network is specially designed for faster payments
              and lower commission. These advantages came at the price of
              security, with the protocol only using five out of nine validator
              nodes to confirm transactions. The hackers managed to crack the
              closed keys of four of these nodes, also gaining access to the
              signature of the third-party validator operated by Axie DAO. As a
              consequence, the criminals managed to make off with 173,600 ETH
              and 25.5 million USDC, which is around $615 million at current
              prices. The theft took place on 23 March but only came to light on
              29 March, when one user was unable to make a 5,000 ETH transaction
              through the Ronin bridge. In a bid to prevent future breaches of
              funds, Sky Mavis has halted operations on its Ronin bridge, while
              the number of validators required to sign off on a transaction has
              been increased to eight. Due to the associated inability to
              arbitrage, the decentralised Katana platform was also disabled.
              The company assures its users that it is making every effort to
              get the stolen funds back and is cooperating fully with law
              enforcement to identify the criminal or criminals. It is also
              worth noting that the stolen funds have not moved since the
              original theft.
