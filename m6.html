              being able to use my computer normally while mining and switching
              to Full Mode automatically after 5 min of inactivity. However,
              there are some times when I want to pass to Full Mode already, or
              I don't want Kryptex to go to Lite Mode if I move the mouse. Right
              now the only way to do this is to go to the Settings tab (icon),
              which takes some time. It would be SO nice to have a button on the
              main screen of the Kryptex app! 147 VOTE API Please release a

              between them, it would be very nice to be able to autoupdate them
              directly from the website. So you dont need physical access to the
              pcs with miners. 105 VOTE Claymore's miner -strap, -cvddc and

              custom settings in the kryptex software to adjust mining times
              according to local peak hours will allow users to mine more
              efficiently, avoiding times of the day Electricity costs the most
              and give a more accurate profit calculation. Adding to this, some
              areas use tiered power, each tier containing so much before the
              cost of electricity goes up. knowing the amount in each tier and
              the cost of each tier will give the most accurate profit
              calculation. 75 VOTE Summary of profitability Can we have a total
              amount of profit on the hardware page, please? 75 VOTE Decrease
              Solutions mined in mining and profitibilty increases i.e. add

              day/month like in the top gpu section. 72 VOTE Email notification
              alert after 1 hour but can it be possible..... Receive Email
              notification alert after One hour but can it be possible that you
              can provide us manually time setting so that one hour time can't
              be wasted can set time to 5 min or 10 min so we have saved our
              time can come to know about offline miner early. Please create
              something so that we came to know early. Thanks and Regards,
              Nikhil Sharma 71 VOTE Mercado Livre Withdrawals 70 VOTE Make a way
              to withdraw to Payoneer. Easy to get a MasterCard from Payoneer,
              with MasterCard you can do all payment online, all shops and also
              you can withdraw cash from an ATM. 69 VOTE Maximize Application
              Launching maximized shortcut of Kryptex works fine, but after some
              time it gets normalized, having multiple cards makes it difficult
              to see all of them. It would be a nice option to have maximized
              button right before closing button on top right corner, as well as
              settings option below "Start with Windows" as "Start Maximized",
              to always have that maximized Kryptex application, showing as most
              things as possible on mining rigs. 69 VOTE Please add WeChat Pay
              It's great to have UnionPay, but WeChat is very nice too 66 VOTE
              Editable mining notification settings Ability to turn on/off
              notifications per mining machine. Also the ability to change time
              until notification as one hour is much to long. Half hour timer at
              the least but even down to 10 minutes would be ideal. 65 VOTE
              Perfect Money Withdrawals Make a way to withdraw to Perfect money!
              64 VOTE money withdrawl by easypaisa 64 VOTE get credit phone get
              credit on the telophone with electronic money ,for those who have
              not very powerful GPUs, I can use credit for phone top-ups 62 VOTE
              Revision/Version running identification On hardware screen via
              web, when you open the down arrow to show the details of your
              rig(s), to also show what version of Kryptex you are on, and a
              update button to remotely update your rigs if needed. 62 VOTE
              Celsius Network payout I would be happy that you include payment
              into Celsius Netowrk account in CEL token. 61 VOTE Add Turkish

              liras to credit cards 59 VOTE Add HKD$ Show the HKD in kryptex 22

              get alerts, and show rigs 18 VOTE Switch web pages (and App) to
              "Dark" mode If this exists I haven't found it yet. But I would
              like to view these web page with a "Dark" theme as an alternative.
              I know Windows and Google have these features in their software.
              Why not here? 17 VOTE Mark the completed ideas mark the completed
              ideas of the community and those that you are accepted, but are in
              development 4 VOTE Fan Control An option for fan control within
              mining app and/or online would be great in case you see GPU temps
              rising while you're away. You could increase or lower your fan
              speeds at the click of a mouse. 3 VOTE A Total at the end of the
              list of the Profitability A total of all the Profitability of all
              the workers at the bottom of the list. that way you dont have to
