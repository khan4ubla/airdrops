              Most crypto miners usually deposit it to exchange or app wallets
              where they can trade it for fiat. However, active traders may want
              to deposit to an exchange or trading app for active trading.
              Consider the Pionex crypto trading robot which features 16
              different trading bots to automate trades. When trading with
              Pionex, the 16 bots let you trade on leverage. The exchange lets
              you deposit with a credit card directly at the exchange in
              addition to using the Pionex Lite app. However, you need to verify
              the account with an ID copy and a selfie, which can take up to 1
              hour to be verified.

              Services and are responsible for such services. For convenience,
              unless otherwise stated, references to “Pionex” and “we” in these
              Terms specifically mean Pionex Operators. Under these terms,

              does not affect your rights and interests under these terms.

              of the dispute, depending on the specific services you use and the
              particular actions that affect your rights or interests. For

              acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take

              User’s instruction. Depending on the type of operating Robot, the
              ceasing of operation can be effective immediately upon the User’s
              instruction, or can be effective after a reasonable period of time
              upon the User’s instruction. We bear no responsibility for any
              loss that you may sustain from the Robots, and you shall be solely
