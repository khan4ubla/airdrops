              procedures (also known as 'Know Your Customer' or 'KYC') are
              required for all the Transactions. If the User refuses to provide
              required documents and information under KYC, Tidex reserves the
              right to immediately terminate the Services provision to the User.
              02 The User undertakes to provide Tidex with correct and relevant
              documents and personal information contained therein. In case the
              User provides counterfeit documents and false personal
              information, such behavior will be interpreted as a fraudulent
              activity. 03 The User hereby authorize Tidex to, directly or
              indirectly (through third parties), make any inquiries we consider
              it necessary to check the relevance and accuracy of the
              information provided for verification purposes. VIII. ACCOUNT
              MAINTENANCE 01 The Site is for the User’s personal and
              non-commercial use only. Tidex is vigilant in maintaining the
              security of the Site and the Service. By registering with Tidex,
              the User agrees to provide Tidex with actual (up to date),
              accurate and complete personal information as prompted by the
              registration process and to keep such information updated. 02 The
              User is allowed to register only one Account on the Platform.
              Thus, any additional Account may be suspended. 03 The User agrees
              that he/she will not use any Account other than their own or
              access the Account of any other User at any time, or assist others
              in obtaining unauthorized access. 04 Tidex reserves the right to
              recommend amount limits for the Account funding/withdrawal. Tidex
              could recommend daily, monthly and per one-transaction amount
              limits but is not obliged to do it. 05 The User is responsible for
              maintaining the confidentiality of information on their Account,
              including, but not limited to their password, email, wallet
              address, wallet balance and of all activities including
              Transactions made via their Account. If there is any suspicious
              activity related to the User’s Account, Tidex may request
              additional information from the User, including authenticating
              documents and freeze the Account for the review time. The User is
              obligated to comply with these security requests or accept
              termination of their Account. 06 Creation or use of the Accounts
              without obtaining a prior permission from Tidex will result in the
              immediate suspension of all respective Accounts, as well as all
              pending buy/sell orders. Any attempt to do so or to assist others
              (Users or other third parties), or distribution of instructions,
              software or tools for that purpose will result in termination of
              such Users’ Accounts. Termination is not an exclusive remedy for
              such a violation and Tidex may decide to take further action
              against the User. IX. TRANSACTIONS 01 The Platform allows the User
              to submit the Orders to buy or sell Cryptocurrencies. 02 The User
              recognizes that the Order should only be submitted after careful
              consideration and the ser understands and accepts consequences of
              its execution. The User agrees that as soon as the Order is
              executed, such transaction is irreversible and may not be
              cancelled. Transactions will be executed instantly upon the
              matching of the Buyer's and the Seller's Orders without prior
              notice to the Seller and the Buyer and will be considered to have
              taken place at the execution date and time. 03 The User
              acknowledges and agrees that in case the destination tag is not
              specified, is incorrectly indicated(in particular XRP, XLM) or the
              reference number is incorrectly specified, the User may lose the
              deposit or at least the processing speed of such requests will be
              made with low priority. 04 Minimum and maximum order amount vary
              for each trading pair and can be seen on the Trade Page when
              placing an Order. 05 The User acknowledges and agrees that Deposit
              and Withdrawal Transaction may be delayed due to some
              verifications and checks (performed by Tidex or appropriate third
              parties). Similarly, and due to the inherent nature of the
              cryptocurrency networks, the User acknowledges and agrees that
              depositing and withdrawing Cryptocurrencies into/from their
              Account may take some time. 06 Unverified users are not allowed to
              withdraw any Cryptocurrencies from their Account. 07 The User can
              use Vouchers to transfer Cryptocurrencies between the Accounts (if
              applicable on the Platform). The Voucher should be redeemed before
              its expiration date set by Tidex. Tidex shall not be liable and
              shall not accept any liability, obligation or responsibility
              whatsoever for any loss or damage arising from the User's use of
              the Vouchers purchased from any third parties or acquired in any
              other way. To avoid doubts, the User is solely responsible for
              ensuring that the Voucher they acquired is genuine and redeemable.
              08 In case if the User discovers transaction activity, including
              but not limited to unknown deposits and withdrawals, on their
              Account that was not initiated by the User, the User shall
              immediately notify Tidex of this fact and follow the instructions
              sent by Tidex. Otherwise, Tidex reserves the right to freeze the
              Account until the end of investigation. X. TRANSACTION AND STORAGE
              FEE 01 The User agrees to pay Tidex the Transaction fee for each
              completed Transaction. 02 Prior to trading, the User must consider
              the Transaction fee rates published on the Fee Schedule page.
              However, Tidex reserves the right to change the Transaction fee
              rates from time to time publishing updates on the Fee Schedule
              page. 03 The Transaction fee amount is automatically charged off
              in the currency indicated on the Platform after the relevant
              Transaction. 04 The minimal transaction fee equals to minimal
              currency amount. The Transaction fee is charged with a rounding in
              the favor of the Platform. The rounding policy for
              cryptocurrencies varies depending on cryptocurrency. 05 For the
              purpose of the processes optimization, transactions on the
              Platform with regard to some items (including, but not limited to
              currencies, cryptocurrencies, etc.) may not be indicated at the
              User’s Account and will appear as soon as a unit is whole in
              accordance with the rounding standards. 06 Minimal and maximal
              price, as well as minimal and maximal order amount vary for each
              trading pair and can be seen on the Trade Page when placing an
              order. XI. ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS 01 Tidex reserves the right to
              suspend or terminate your Tidex Account at any time if we
              reasonably believe to be required to do so by the law or in order
              to comply with recommendations issued by a relevant government
              authority or recognized body for the prevention of financial
              crime. 02 It is strictly forbidden to use the Account for any
              illegal purposes. Tidex will report any suspicious activity to the
              relevant law enforcement. 03 The User shall ensure that they do
              not use the Services for the transactions relating to: money
              laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation of weapons of mass
              destruction; human trafficking; any goods or services that are
              illegal or the promotion, offer or marketing of which is illegal

              postures, depict means of propaganda or signs of unconstitutional
              organizations glorifying war or violating human dignity; any goods
              or services, promotion, offer or marketing of which would violate
              copyrights, industrial property rights or other rights of any
              person; archeological findings; drugs, narcotics or hallucinogens;
              weapons of any kind; illegal gambling services; Ponzi, pyramid or

              minors; body parts or human remains; protected animals or
              protected plants; weapons or explosive materials; or any other
              illegal goods, services or transactions. XII. ACCOUNT SECURITY 01
              The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
              their Account’s credentials, including, but not limited to a
              password, email, wallet address, balance and of all activity
              including Transactions made through the Account. 02 Tidex
              personnel will never ask the User to disclose their password. Any
              message the User receives or website that he/she visits that asks
              for the password, other than the Tidex Site, should be reported to
              Tidex. Before each using of the Website the User has to check
              (ensure) that he is using a genuine website. 03 We advise to
              change the User’s password regularly in order to reduce the risk
              of a security breach in relation to the Account. The User must
              never allow anyone to access his/her Account or watch the User
              accessing his/her Account. If the User has any security concerns
              concerning his/her Account, login details, (password or other
              security feature being lost, stolen, misappropriated, used without
              authorization or otherwise compromised), the User is advised to
              change the password immediately. The User must contact support
              service without undue delay on becoming aware of any loss, theft,
              misappropriation or unauthorized use of the Account, login
              details, password or other security features. Any undue delay in
              notifying Tidex may not only affect the security of the Account
              but may result in the User being liable for any losses as a
              result. If the User suspects that someone else accessed his/her
              Account, the User should also contact an appropriate government
              agency and report the incident. 04 The User must take reasonable
              care to ensure that his/her e-mail account(s) are secure and only
              accessed by the User, as his/her e-mail address may be used to
              reset passwords or to communicate with the User about the security
              of the Account. Tidex cannot be liable for the breach of an e-mail
              account resulting an unauthorized Transaction to be executed with
              proper confirmation. In case any of the e-mail addresses
              registered with the User’s Accounts are compromised, the User
              should without undue delay after becoming aware of this contact
              Support Service and also contact his/her e-mail service provider.
              05 Irrespective of whether the User is using a public, a shared or
              his/her own computer to access the Account, the User must always
              ensure that his/her login details are not stored by the browser,
              cached or otherwise recorded. The User should never use any
              functionality that allows login details or passwords to be stored
              by the computer he/she is using. 06 Additional products or
              services the User uses may have additional security requirements
              and the User must familiarize with those as notified to him/her.
              07 We strictly recommend to use additional authentication options
              of the Platform. XIII. TERMINATION OF THE TERMS OF USE 01 The User
              may terminate the Terms of Use and close their Account at any
              time, following settlement of any pending transactions. 02 The
              User also agrees that Tidex may, by giving notice, at its sole
              discretion terminate his/her access to the Site and to his/her
              Account, including without limitation, our right to: limit,
              suspend or terminate the service and the Users' Accounts, prohibit
              access to the Site and its content, services and tools, delay or
              remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep
              the User off the Site if we think that he/she or his/her
              activity/deeds linked to illegal activity, infringing the
              intellectual property rights of third parties or acting
              inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms.
              Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our
              discretion, suspend or terminate Account of User for any reason,
              including without limitation: (1) attempts to gain unauthorized
              access to the Site or another User's account or providing
              assistance to others' attempting to do so, (2) overcoming software
              security features limiting use of or protecting any content, (3)
              usage of the Service to perform illegal activities such as money
              laundering, illegal gambling operations, financing terrorism, or
              other criminal activities, (4) violations of these Terms of Use,
              (5) failure to pay or fraudulent payment for Transactions, (6)
              unexpected operational difficulties, or (7) upon the request of
              law enforcement or other government agencies, if deemed to be
              legitimate and compelling by Tidex, acting at its sole discretion.
              03 Tidex also reserves the right to cancel unconfirmed Accounts or
              Accounts that have been inactive for a period of six (6) months or
              more and/or to modify or discontinue our Site or Service. The User
              agrees that Tidex will not be liable to them or to any third party
              for termination of their Account or access to the Site. 04 The
              suspension of the Account shall not affect the payment of the
              Transaction fees due for past Transactions. Upon termination, the
              User shall provide a valid account details or cryptocurrency
              address to allow the transfer of any currencies deposited to
              his/her Account. Tidex shall transfer the currencies as soon as

              01 Tidex Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer Policy
              (hereinafter — the “AML/KYC Policy”) is designated to prevent and
              mitigate possible risks of Tidex being involved in any kind of
              illegal activity. Both international and local regulations require
              Tidex to implement effective internal procedures and mechanisms to
              prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, drug and human
              trafficking, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
              corruption and bribery and to take action in case of any form of
              suspicious activity from its Users. AML/KYC Policy covers the
              following matters: Verification procedures. Compliance Officer.
              Monitoring Transactions. Risk Assessment. 02 Verification
              procedures One of the international standards for preventing
              illegal activity is customer due diligence (“CDD”).According to
              CDD, Tidex establishes its own verification procedures within the
              standards of anti-money laundering and “Know Your Customer”
              frameworks. Identity verification Tidex’s identity verification
              procedure requires the User to provide Tidex with reliable,
              independent source documents, data or information (e.g., national
              ID, international passport, bank statement, utility bill). For
              such purposes Tidex reserves the right to collect User’s
              identification information for the AML/KYC Policy purposes. Tidex
              will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and
              information provided by the Users. All legal methods for
              double-checking identification information will be used and Tidex
              reserves the right to investigate certain Users who have been
              determined to be risky or suspicious. Tidex reserves the right to
              verify User’s identity in an on-going basis, especially when their
              identification information has been changed or their activity
              seemed to be suspicious (unusual for the particular User). In
              addition, Tidex reserves the right to request up-to-date documents
              from the Users, even though they have passed identity verification
              in the past. User’s identification information will be collected,
              stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the
              Tidex’s Privacy Policy and related regulations. Once the User’s
              identity has been verified, Tidex is able to remove itself from
              potential legal liability in a situation where its Services are
              used to conduct illegal activity. 03 Identity verification Tidex’s
              identity verification procedure requires the User to provide Tidex
              with reliable, independent source documents, data or information
              (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement,
              utility bill). For such purposes Tidex reserves the right to
              collect User’s identification information for the AML/KYC Policy
              purposes. Tidex will take steps to confirm the authenticity of
              documents and information provided by the Users. All legal methods
              for double-checking identification information will be used and
              Tidex reserves the right to investigate certain Users who have
              been determined to be risky or suspicious. Tidex reserves the
              right to verify User’s identity in an on-going basis, especially
              when their identification information has been changed or their
              activity seemed to be suspicious (unusual for the particular
              User). In addition, Tidex reserves the right to request up-to-date
              documents from the Users, even though they have passed identity
              verification in the past. User’s identification information will
              be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance
              with the Tidex’s Privacy Policy and related regulations. 04
              Compliance Officer The Compliance Officer is the person, duly
              authorized by Tidex, whose duty is to ensure the effective
              implementation and enforcement of the AML/KYC Policy. It is the
              Compliance Officer’s responsibility to supervise all aspects of
              Tidex’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing,
              including but not limited to: a. Collecting Users’ identification
              information. b. Establishing and updating internal policies and
              procedures for the completion, review, submission and retention of
              all reports and records required under the applicable laws and
              regulations. c. Monitoring transactions and investigating any
              significant deviations from normal activity. d. Implementing a
              records management system for appropriate storage and retrieval of
              documents, files, forms and logs. e. Updating risk assessment
              regularly. f. Providing law enforcement with information as
              required under the applicable laws and regulations. The Compliance
              Officer is entitled to interact with law enforcement, which are
              involved in prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing
              and other illegal activity. 05 Monitoring Transactions The Users
              are known not only by verifying their identity (who they are) but,
              more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns (what
              they do). Therefore, Tidex relies on data analysis as a
              risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. Tidex performs a
              variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data,
              filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and
              reporting. System functionalities include: 1) Daily check of Users
              against recognized “black lists” (e.g. OFAC), aggregating
              transfers by multiple data points, placing Users on watch and
              service denial lists, opening cases for investigation where
              needed, sending internal communications and filling out statutory
              reports, if applicable; 2) Case and document management. With
              regard to the AML/KYC Policy, Tidex will monitor all transactions
              and it reserves the right to: ensure that transactions of
              suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement
              through the Compliance Officer; request the User to provide any
              additional information and documents in case of suspicious
              transactions; suspend or terminate User’s Account when Tidex has
              reasonably suspicion that such User engaged in illegal activity.
              The above list is not exhaustive and the Compliance Officer will
              monitor Users’ transactions on a day-to-day basis in order to
              define whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as
              suspicious or are to be treated as bona fide. 06 Risk Assessment
              Tidex, in line with the international requirements, has adopted a
              risk-based approach to combating money laundering and terrorist
              financing. By adopting a risk-based approach, Tidex is able to
              ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and
              terrorist financing are commensurate to the identified risks. This
              will allow resources to be allocated in the most efficient ways.
              The principle is that resources should be directed in accordance
              with priorities so that the greatest risks receive the highest
              attention. XIX. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION 01 These
              Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
              the laws of Hong Kong, unless otherwise expressly provided. 02 All
              disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract
              shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the
              Rules of the Arbitration Court of the Estonian Chamber of Commerce
              and Industry. The Parties shall attempt to resolve all disputes
              relating to these Terms of Use by negotiations. If the Parties
              fail to resolve the disputes relating to these Terms of Use
              through negotiations, the dispute shall be conclusively resolved

              of Estonia in Tallinn (hereinafter: the Arbitration Court) in
              accordance with the Rules of the Arbitration Court. The dispute
              shall be resolved on the basis of the laws of Estonia. The
              language of the Arbitration Court shall be Estonian. The
              Arbitration Court shall consist of 3 (three) members. Each Party
              shall appoint one arbitrator within the time period prescribed by
              the Council of the Arbitration Court of the Chamber of Commerce
              and Industry of Estonia. Each Party shall ask the arbitrator
              chosen by him to appoint a third arbitrator together with the
              arbitrator chosen by the other Party, who shall be the chairman of
              the Arbitration Court in the resolution of the dispute. If the
              arbitrators appointed by the Parties fail to choose a third
              arbitrator within the time period prescribed by the Council of the
              Arbitration Court of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of
              Estonia, the third arbitrator who shall also be the chairman of
              the Arbitration Court shall be appointed by the Council of the
              Arbitration Court of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. If the
              Parties fail to form the Arbitration Court in accordance with the
              provisions of these Terms of Use and the Rules of the Arbitration
              Court, the Arbitration Court shall be formed by the Council of the
              Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Estonia. The award of the
              Arbitration Court shall be final and binding upon the Parties. XX.

              the User uses the Services after the publishing of the revised
              Terms of Use and shall apply on a going-forward basis with respect
              to any activity initiated after publishing. In the event that the

              and exclusive remedy is to terminate the use of the Services and
              close the Account. The User agrees that Tidex shall not be liable
              to the User or any third party as a result of any losses suffered

              and other governing documents of any other website that you may
              visit. XXV. Terms of delisting. 01 Tidex reserves the right to
              exclude the Coin (Token) from the exchange if Tidex really
              discovers that the Initiator or the official team of the Coin
              (Token) has disintegrated, did not immediately respond to
              problems, or that information about the Coin (Token) or the
              identity of the Initiator is falsified. Reasons for exclusion may
              include: The official team is disbanded or no longer supports the
              Coin (Token); 02 The digital currency is weak (less than $ 1000
              per day in continuous circulation based on 5 trading days) or the
              user does not make transactions and does not comply with the
              spread support conditions: the difference between the selling and
              buying prices of the Coin should not exceed 3% of the current
              price. 03 If problems with blockchain transactions or other
              technical problems last more than 10 days and the Initiator did
              not fix them; 04 If the Initiator did not fix the blockchain
              transaction problems or other technical problems after the third
              Tidex request; 05 If it is necessary to prevent and/or stop fraud,
              exchange manipulation, violation of securities or other
              laws/regulations, hacker attacks and/or if there are signs of
              fraud, violation of laws/regulations related to the
              listing/trading of coins (Token) is defined; 06 If the Initiator
              violates its obligations, other terms of this Agreement and/or the
              terms of use. 07 Tidex will send a notification 7 days before the
              coin is removed. All coins must be withdrawn from customer
              accounts within 7 days. Once Tidex closes its wallet, withdrawals
              will not be possible under any circumstances. In case of problems
              due to a non-working blockchain or wallet that does not allow
              Tidex to make transactions, the Initiator must independently make
              corrections (compensate for the damage) to its users. 08 After
              confirming the de-listing procedure, the Initiator's command will
              be immediately notified. Tidex will inform the Initiator of the
              time frame, including stages such as stopping trading, financing
              and withdrawing funds. CONTACT US If you have any questions
